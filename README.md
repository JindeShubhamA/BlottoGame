This folder contains the necessary steps required to run the logic as well as simulation

#Running without frontend simulation

1. To run the code without UI simulation
   Default command
   python main.py --troops 8 --battlefields 3 --orderofagent1 3 --orderofagent2 1  --simulation 0

These are compulsory command line arguments.__
Troops = Number of troops__
Battlefield = Number of battlefields__
orderofagent1 = Theory of mind order of the agent1  (Order of agent1 should be higher than agent2 for this experiment)
orderofagent2 = Theory of mind order of agent2
simulation = 0 if you don't want to see UI simulation(Both agents will compete for 100 rounds in this case )__
             1 if you want to see UI simulation(Both agents will compete for 1 round in this case)__
